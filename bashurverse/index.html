        <p>
            Brandon Ashur, known mainly as 'Bashurverse' was another of the popular cast associated with Skydoesminecraft. He gained over a million subscribers over the early 2010s. The main reason for his downfall was not because of current 'misconducts', but rather the exposure of an arrest he underwent 10 years prior in 2004. The backlash was brutal, and Ashur was driven clean off the platform as a result.
