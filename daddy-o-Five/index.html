        <p>
            Daddy-o-Five, or Michael Martin (and his wife Heather Martin) were a classic "prank" style family channel that mainly focused on absurd and chaotic videos meant for kids (because of course that is whats meant for children on this platform). They recieved wide criticism for their videos, as viewers often noticed genuinely abusive tendencies between the parents and their kids (two of which are foster children). In 2017, The Martins were proescuted for child neglect and their channel ceased.

        <h2>====Crime/Allegation List====</h2>
        <p>Summary of Crimes/Allegation </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Official charge: Two counts of child neglect in 2017. Both cody and emma were then sent into the custody of their biological mother in 2017   </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many videos would exhibit abusive behavior between the parents and children, with the treatment of Cody and Emma being highlighted the most.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a video titled "Dad Destroys Son's XBOX One PRANK!" (yes, thats a real video), Michael simply destroys his son's xbox and calls it a "prank"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Video titled "Cody gets Put Up for ADOPTION Prank" is just one part of many "were giving you up" style videos directed at Cody which causes legitimate emotional trauma for the child.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Video titled "Invisible Ink Prank! (Epic Freakout)" is quite literally just the parents spreading ink on the floor, blaming the children and screaming at them for the entire duration of the video, then revealing the "prank"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Many videos were cited as evidence for emotional trauma which is why the charge was deemed as neglect rather than abuse.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Allegations: Child abuse </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The videos never contained actual physical abuse, though viewers speculated that there may have been some going on behind the scenes (reasonably so)
