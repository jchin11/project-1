        <h1>====Jinbop====</h1>
        <p> Starlit Zhao, aka 'Jinbop' was a semi-popular minecraft youtuber who was mainly the "sidecast" to Skydoesminecraft in Skymedia. Seems to be a trend with association to Sky. Not long after he left Skymedia, Zhao would interact explicitly with a minor, ultimately resulting in his arrest by the FBI.
