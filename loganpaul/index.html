        <h1>====Logan Paul====</h1>
        <p>
            If you know where the image is from, then you know exactly why he's on this list. Logan Paul is arguably one the most popular youtubers of all time. You can't really associate him as a youtuber anymore, he has branched off into doing crypto (the topic of this page), wrestling, and podcasting now. None of that stops him from scamming his audience though, which happens to be primarily children. In 2021 (and till present day) Paul started advertising Crypto currency, resulting in him rugpulling the investments after it (inevitably) fell through.

        <h2>====Crime/Allegation List====</h2>
        <p>Summary of Crimes/Allegation </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Class action lawsuit filed against Paul and his associates over Cryptozoo in 2023.   </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CryptoZoo is essentially an "NFT" (non fungible token) video game where players breed animals and earn "zoo tokens" which are essentially the yield
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Paul pitched this idea in 2021, causing fans to invest in the project, but the actual promised game loop where you can keep buying and hatching animals never came, and thus the economy in this game never sustained.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the investors lost the value they put into the game, leaving them with nothing and Paul/his associates with everything
                    </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Paul and associates turn on one another, blaming the other party for the games failure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is found out that half of Paul's team were associated with other crypto scams.
