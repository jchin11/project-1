        <h1>====Prince Family====</h1>
        <p>
            (Yes, you've probably seen this image and yes, it is from this family) The Prince family, Damien and Bianca Prince and their daughter, are mostly known for their proclaimed "child friendly" content which generally includes highly clickbait videos and "pranks." I put these terms in quotes because this stuff could be anything but child friendly or a prank. Also the fact that Damien met and engaged romantically with Bianca when she was 15 does not help their case. In general, this is barely a family, let alone a dysfunctional one.

        <h2>====Crime/Allegation List====</h2>
        <p>Summary of Crimes/Allegation </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Scamming: The family started up a paid "creator course" called D&B University, which was essentially an assortment of "courses" designed to teach fans how to be successful on youtube.   </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many creators called this out as "fake" and a "scam", which is believable given their history with content and absurd clickbait.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prank videos also garner views by staging obviously faked 'pranks' (which is a common theme on kid oriented youtube)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Allegations: Grooming. Damien originally met Bianca at a Little Caesars while (allegedly) he was 20, and she was 15.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    They are currently married, and their lsited birthdays + self reported 2012 meeting date imply that this is by all means an illegal relationship. There are no official reports, but fans widely accuse Damien over this.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li> Alleged: Sexually explicit depiction of minors. There was a video uploaded on their channel where they "guess the age of the female in the picture" and many were supposedly underage. That's not a joke, this is something they actually did. The thumbnail was absurd, and criticized heavily.</li>
