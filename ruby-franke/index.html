        <h1>====Ruby Franke====</h1>
        <p>
            Ruby Franke is the mother behind the family channel "8 Passengers" where she covered "family life" to over 2 million subscribers. This is probably the worst case of atrocious child treatment ever seen in a family channel. The stories behind this woman were harrowing enough to be covered on a true crime youtube channel that posts BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE!! (which is how her downfall began). She was arrested on multiple accounts of child abuse in 2023.
