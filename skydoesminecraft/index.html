        <h1>====Sky Does Minecraft====</h1>
        <p>Adam Dahlberg, popularly known as Sky Does Minecraft was one of (if not the most) popular Minecraft youtubers of all time. Their popularity skyrocketed in the early 2010s as the go-to channel for funny minecraft videos (for a 12 year old). Seriously, the terms 'butter' and 'squid' were internet phenomenons because of Adam. Most of the controversy around Adam didn't emerge until much later after their departure from youtube, but the signs were there. Long story short, Adam was seriously addicted to drugs which led them to verbally and physically abuse every single one of their partners.
